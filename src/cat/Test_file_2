It was an ordinary grey autumn day in 1993. You came home from work at Hewlett-Packard, feeling a little tired. You lived in a small two-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of N town. In the fridge was a low-alcohol drink called "Pivo". You took the drink and a bag of crackers, then went to your little corner, to your Dell computer.
*Click* — the power button was pressed. A few minutes of boot loading and... yeah, it feels good. You always get that feeling when you switch on a computer. A few seconds of undisturbed pleasure and you opened the Mosaic browser. Then you went to your favourite forum and read a few threads while sipping a Pivo. Suddenly you come across a very interesting discussion that started with the following message:
Hello everybody out there using minix -
I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things). I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-

PS. Yes — it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.
